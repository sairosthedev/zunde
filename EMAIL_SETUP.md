# ðŸ“§ Email Configuration Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview
This guide will help you set up email functionality for the Zunde Registration System using Gmail SMTP.

## ðŸ”§ Step 1: Gmail App Password Setup

### 1.1 Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/)
2. Click on "Security" in the left sidebar
3. Under "Signing in to Google", click "2-Step Verification"
4. Follow the prompts to enable 2FA if not already enabled

### 1.2 Generate App Password
1. In your Google Account settings, go to "Security"
2. Under "Signing in to Google", click "App passwords"
3. Select "Mail" as the app
4. Select "Other (Custom name)" and enter "Zunde Registration System"
5. Click "Generate"
6. **Copy the 16-character password** (you won't see it again!)

## ðŸ”§ Step 2: Update Environment Variables

Update your `.env.local` file with the following email configuration:

```env
# Email Configuration (Gmail)
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password

# Alternative: Generic SMTP (if not using Gmail)
# SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
# SMTP_PORT=587
# SMTP_SECURE=false
```

## ðŸ”§ Step 3: Test Email Configuration

npm run dev
```

### 3.2 Test Email Functionality
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/test-system`
2. Click "Test Email Sending"
3. Check the console for email sending logs
4. Check your email inbox for the test email

## ðŸ“‹ Email Features

### âœ… Registration Confirmation

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### 1. "Invalid login" error
- **Solution**: Make sure you're using the App Password, not your regular Gmail password
- **Check**: Verify 2FA is enabled on your Google account

#### 2. "Less secure app access" error
- **Solution**: Use App Passwords instead of enabling "less secure apps"
- **Note**: App Passwords are more secure than the deprecated "less secure apps" setting

#### 3. Emails not being sent
- **Check**: Console logs for error messages
- **Verify**: Environment variables are correctly set
- **Test**: Use the test system to verify configuration

#### 4. Emails going to spam
- **Solution**: Add the sender email to your contacts
- **Note**: This is normal for automated emails from new domains

## ðŸ”’ Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** to version control
2. **Use App Passwords** instead of your main Gmail password
3. **Regularly rotate** your App Passwords
4. **Monitor** your Gmail account for suspicious activity
5. **Use a dedicated email** for the application if possible

## ðŸ“Š Email Templates

The system includes beautiful HTML email templates for:

- **Registration Confirmations**: Professional e-ticket with QR code
